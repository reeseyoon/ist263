        I am Reese Yoon, currently majoring in Innovation, Society and Technology in the iSchool. With a minor in psychology, learning the combination of how technology and the societal branches can be intertwined together makes my academic course works very interesting. With a strong interest in the utilization of AI and cloud computing, I am always seeking for more professional skills I can gain through my life at the iSchool. So far, some of the skills I gained are Python programming that includes handling with HTML, JSON, and API and other than programming languages, I am confident in using both the Mac and Windows operating systems and the Adobe programs. Outside of work, I like to keep a journal throughout the year where I could write down my ideas, concerns, powerful lines from a book, and even some drawings which makes it fun to look back at the end of each year.
